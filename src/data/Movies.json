The Special Edition cut of 1993, made with Pioneer Technology, specially for LaserDisc, 2 hours and 33 minutes. Entering the 5 digit code, just like The Ultimate Edition DVD (82997), will allow the viewer to access the Extended Special Edition, released in 2000, adding 5 more minutes of data. The film would be released through Lions Gate Home Entertainment, and still through Studio Canal US through distribution rights. The Skynet Access Map and BD-Live servers are no longer available as the service has been shut down completely, as the same with Skynet Access, as the service has a requirement with an Internet Connection.",
